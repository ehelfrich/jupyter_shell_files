### How to launch a Jupyter Notebook on a remote server

These scripts will launch a Jupyter Notebook on a remote server on your LAN.  You must have an SSH key setup to allow you to remote into your server without using a password.  The script can be modified to use a set password, but using public/private keys allows the scripts to not hold any passwords.  The scripts will check to see if processes are up and if they are killed.

The scripts are slightly Battlestar Galactica themed.  aler_one will launch the notebook and SSH tunnel and combat_landing will close them.

*These are for my reference, but anyone is welcome to view and modify for their own use.*
